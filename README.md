# screen-manager
Screen-manager, once triggered runs in the background capturing screenshots at specified intervals of the live screen. I was facing
a severe bug in my regular time-tracker & screenshot manager application on my go-to machine(using OSX). That's why I've decided to
write such an application and planning to extend it over the time.
